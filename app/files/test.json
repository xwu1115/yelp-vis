        "text": "I like Chianti, the outdoor seating area is nice during the spring and fall, while the inside typifies an average Las Vegas dinner spot. The staff is attentive. Entrees are tasty, I liked the beef carpaccio appetizer, as well as the nice, simple pasta dishes and pizzas, and the cioppino is (surprisingly) pretty good too (although the tomato broth is a little overwhelming and the seafood is obviously not coastal fresh). The bread/crostini is horrible (ala white Wonder Bread). Decent wine list, but less than helpful staff in that regard. Overall, I would recommend this spot to anyone stranded in Vegas and craving a bowl of cioppino (p.s., if you know of a better spot for cioppino in Vegas please let me know).",

        "text": "My wife and I went to Chianti for our anniversary.  And, we had a 20% off coupon.  We started with the garlic bread and as an appy ordered the cheesy artichoke dip (Carciofi Gratinati).  Both were wonderful, as were the drinks on the specials menu.  For our entrees, we ordered the Margherita pizza and the eggplant parm (Melanzane Alla Parmigiana).  The pizza was.....OK, nothing to write home about, but the eggplant parm was absolutely perfect, with the accompanying pasta served perfectly al dente.  We mentioned to the excellently attentive waiter that it was our anniversary, and he brought out a huge slice of tiramisu for our dessert, without our asking for it, and without charging us for it!  And when he brought out the check, we noticed he'd taken the 20% off the entire meal, including alcohol.  Doesn't get any better than that.  Now if they could only make the pizza a little more enticing, they'd earn five stars.",

Chef, Alvino, has a passion fro cooking that shines through in his food creations. Our waiter, Chris, assisted us in selecting an interesting wine and was attentive throughout the meal, making our evening a lovely experience.   The owner, Jim, stopped by our table several times to assure that our dinning experience was pleasant.  If you are looking for good food made with fresh ingredients and service from people who care, the Chianti Cafe is the place for you.",

        "text": "We were in the Las Vegas / Summerlin area and needed an early dinner before driving back to LA.  With the use of Yelp on my iPhone, my family and decided to try Chianti Cafe which was nearby.  We were thrilled with this place.  Nice quiet ambiance with delicous italian entrees.  The place has an air of sophistication but is not pretentious--very down to earth fine dining.  Service was excellent and friendly.   We ordered from the chef's additions to the menu of that day.  The orange roughy with the special sauce (which I cannot remember the name of) was excellent.  The Linquini with fresh clams (with shell and all) in white sauce was a treat.  The italian sausage rigatoni (they had a different name for it) was slightly bland for my taste, but, was still very good.\n\nGreat place.  We also like the baked bread with Tapenade while we waited.",

The staff is so friendly and hospitable and make you feel as if you have been coming there forever on your first visit. \nI love going here for a relaxing  dinner or drinks and appetizers at the bar with friends.  Anytime friends or family come to visit, my boyfriend and I always make sure to take them here.  The lobster ravioli is to die for, although I believe that is a limited item. \nThe bread and tapenade are always enjoyable. This is one place I definitely don't mind paying alittle more for.",

        "text": "Chianti cafe is not a place worth going out of your way for, but if in the area you can get a better than average lunch at a reasonable price. In fact, they publicize their lunch menu as \"everything under $10,\" so you're pretty much forced to be frugal. If you have been there before, I'd like to let you know it has recently changed management. Apparently the restaurant was going downhill before they did, so if you had a bad experience you might want to try it again.\n\nMy Greca salad ($7.95) was quite enjoyable, and a touch unique. It was tossed with a creamy garlic dressing rather than a vinaigrette, which was a nice change, and the feta cheese was not of your standard supermarket variety. This cheese was soft and mild, without much salt. Though I personally prefer feta with a little more tang,  this was of good quality nonetheless and you do get some brininess from the kalamata olives.\n\nMy husband had the pastrami sandwich ($9.95) which was tasty but not delivered as promised. Instead of fries it came with a good version of basil mashed potatoes (I still would have preferred fries) and instead of the more appropriate rye bread listed in the description it was served on a soft hoagie. Additionally, the presentation was pretty sloppy as mustard was EVERYWHERE around the outside. There was too much mustard inside the sandwich as well, and it would have benefited from the use of whole grain or deli mustard rather than yellow. I still liked it as the pastrami itself was tender and delicious, but with a little improvement it would have been great.\n\nOverall, it was a good lunch at a reasonable price, but not a real find by any means. I've had their pasta, which is fine, but not great, and the menu is fairly mainstream. It's just your average neighborhood Italian eatery in a nice area.",
